Hello, I wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not received a response yet.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived the day before yesterday (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is currently not usable.
The engine control of the LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved again.
A variably adjustable PWM clock frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures super quiet operation, especially for bell anchor motors - the typical "humming" is a thing of the past.
The load control can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" function allows for the automatic calibration of the decoder to the engine.
The LokSound 5 decoder, with up to 1.5A motor current, provides enough power even for older motors.

New York wins MLS Championship for the first time.
New York City FC has won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After a 1:1 draw in regular playtime against host team Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in a penalty shootout with a 4:2 score.
In the Eastern Conference final, New York prevailed over Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg Fan Day.
The Europa-Park, the namesake for the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg fan day.
As the park announced, members and season ticket holders of the sports club from Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit Europa-Park for free on this day.
Additionally, there were vouchers for drinks and sausage.
The roller coaster trains were glowing red and white that day due to the jerseys.
"Füchsle, Ed Euromaus, and many red and white balloons created the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has been in place since the early 90s.
The first SC Freiburg fan day at Europa-Park once again demonstrated how well the partnership fits.
"Seeing radiant fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them are leaving.
Only the one that I bought today doesn't work.
But we would still like the shelf module, specifically a new, undamaged one.
And not cancel the entire order.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain a different type of packaging.
I will dismantle the cupboard and be able to make it available to the transport company in this way.
However, I cannot mount the underframe on the tabletop.
It is about Custom #NAME#.
Of that, there are 3 versions.
We wanted those with a tabletop diameter of #NUMBER#
We have received 155cm in diameter.
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail.
Child, four years old, has a wood splinter under the thumbnail (outer side) along the entire length.
Have tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very hard to grasp.
It didn't work out and it hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chances.
Tomorrow, I am going to the doctor.
It works.
Thank you very much for the help.
Wish you a pleasant evening.
I have to print this out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
Do I not need to click/fill in/provide anything else here?
Hello, unfortunately I can't get into the customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice from order number #NUMBER# again to the email address provided above?
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Will I receive a confirmation for this via email?
I have already been assured of this by your colleagues 3 times...how reliable is your information?
When will the freight company contact me?
It still doesn't work, I can only see the cover page but can't flip through.
I will not be present on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I cannot be present due to a funeral, unfortunately, this cannot be changed.
Can an alternative pick-up date be assigned to me, please?
From the 1st of February, I will be continuously available again.
"Why Children Aren't Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I immediately watched it.
The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures all over Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on parenting.
Former patients and legal guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people nowadays think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible parties should never, never, never! be about exerting power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for their development and to make the framework for the child as large as is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
I request a callback, as my delivered wooden table was delivered damaged.
Corpus fracture due to damaged delivery from #PRS_ORG#.

I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame, which was attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks unpleasant.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repacked it into the package and sealed it.
What do I need to do next for the return?
Is there a guide for assembly?
How long would I have to get these or decide to return them?
I was in a chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
The following error message always appears after confirmation: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have reset the #PRS_ORG#, restarted it, connected it to the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
I just received an email that my package is being returned to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and place the order again?
This would unfortunately mean for me that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Whether as a comforter for stomach aches or just for cuddling - My little heat friend is versatile.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they are not feeling so well.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for unusual smells, stains, or burn marks and dispose of it immediately if present.
Please remove the inner pillow from the cover before heating it!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (follow the microwave manufacturer's instructions!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking it!
Then place the inner pillow back into the cover.
During the initial warm-ups, there may be slight moisture formation on the surface, but this disappears with repeated use.
You must strictly adhere to the provided heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burning!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that the manufacturer's instructions allow for the heating of grain products.
After the warmed inner cushion has been placed back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) on your inner elbow!
Do not use the pillow in cases of acute and chronic inflammatory or febrile diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, bruises, and open wounds, as well as in individuals with reduced pain sensation.
Please consult a doctor before use if you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases, or if you are pregnant.
If seams have opened and loose cores are leaking out, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and out of reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be regularly monitored during use to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the relevant authority of the country where the user is located.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30 °C.
Please pay attention to the care symbols on the product!
Lahnsteiner Weir equipped for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the state.
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant notice amounting to 45,000 Euros for the new water rescue equipment vehicle of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department to Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein City Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 Euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment vehicle is used by the Lahnstein Diving Squad, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they are constantly expecting increasing operations: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle, as well as the continued increasing use of the Lahn as a recreational river, contribute to this.
Here, the lower part, essentially the part with storage space, was damaged.
Will everything be picked up again or just the storage part?
Which vouchers???
I did not receive my voucher credit for my last order!
I have done that several times, it doesn't work.
Topic of the week: The best low budget films.
What exactly constitutes a low-budget film, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the internet, one can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What attracts you to it?
And what do you perhaps not like at all?
I am waiting for a pickup appointment.
What do you mean by give back, please!
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I received many great tips for the perfect goulash here a week ago.
That was served for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery tender!
So, thanks again for that :)
Now I've acquired a taste for it and want to cook roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow, I will start making a beef broth.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, only a large pot.
And what about the voucher??
Otherwise, I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat surface is.....
No, it's the same with all books, hence the inquiry at #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is responsible for adjusting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is simple and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very bright stream of light with high-quality, soft light, completely flicker-free.
The emission angle of 120 degrees, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively short distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work with, both on the film set and in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
The control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display, is located on the back of the light.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, the slot for the NP-F batteries is located there (not included in the delivery).
User Memory: The memory can store up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To set the individual settings on the memory slots, simply hold down one of the memory buttons for a longer period of time, and it's done.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned back on, the known situation is restored - very practical for studio work, for example, when the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
Working with a battery is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality, resulting from the ability to operate with affordable NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - a battery tester is built in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display indicators (the left battery upper display, the right one on the lower display).
Furthermore, it is of course possible to continuously power the spotlight using the supplied power adapter.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm sleeve for attachment as a connection, so you can directly attach it to your camera tripod.
The inclination can be reliably adjusted using the setters on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that even the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and heavy use.
Additionally, a swivel joint is included in the delivery.
It's great that a bag is also included in the package.
Thus, you can transport or store the lamp with all the accessories that you might want to buy, without any problems.
Air pumps are excellent for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered by us in 3 variants.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can compare the services.
If the pumps are strong enough, one can operate entire systems with them.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so you can connect several diffusers.
The MK series has one, two, or four outputs, depending on the model of the fan pump, but it can also be used to set an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decor, which converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here, one could mention a treasure chest, shell, or something similar.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction, thus ensuring low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an air outlet or similar via a 4/6 mm air hose...and then it can get started.
The fan pump should be level with, or higher than, the water level and should be installed externally.
If the fan pump is positioned lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and insert the valve in between.
This would prevent, if water were to ever flow backwards, the water from running from the basin through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, like other air pumps, it should be covered and protected from moisture.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we state a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, packing is done daily and the packages are also picked up daily from here.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to take some precautions, so that no one is upset just because it took a little longer than expected.
It would be like this, not everyone understands all the employees who also work in the freight industry...of course, Corona doesn't stop here.
Please do not rate poorly just because the delivery is delayed, as this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, even though we say at the moment... they have it damn hard.
This also varies greatly by region.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
Could you please send me the three variants by email and tell me the best way to reach you again?
Pill problem
Hello dear ladies,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, this is actually my first post on Reddit after a year.
Regarding my problem: About five years ago, I was forced to start taking the pill again, primarily because I had such incredibly severe pain during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
Now I would like to stop doing that, because due to chronic illnesses I already have to take enough medications that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
During my last break of about two years, I suddenly got pimples from 0 to 100 and they were everywhere.
As superficial as it may seem, it really weighed on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, things never really returned to normal.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this happening again.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without fuss, but perhaps there's something that someone can recommend to me.
The gynecologist unfortunately did not take me very seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still to come.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had severe neurodermatitis pre-puberty, then a period of calm, then widespread nodular prurigo and the acne issue.
I've also tried all sorts of diets due to chronic illness and ended up sticking with a diet low in sugar, milk, and meat, because nothing else really worked well.
It could also be that there's simply a hormonal imbalance, but when you're dealing with issues everywhere like I am, you'd rather not go looking for what else might be going wrong.
I already sent you an email, which you have not answered.
The question again.
The order and the invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The forwarding company is #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was informed that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I must cancel the order, as I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor for me.
Am I not being called?
I had formulated a question.
If I have downloaded a book onto the #PRS_ORG#, the message comes up that your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book.
Are there any problems there?
A voucher sounds great.
Then I will redeem it independently with the new order.
Thank you very much for the quick clarification!
Proper through child?
Hello, something has been bothering me (a 32-year-old woman) for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am self-employed, with very little free time), but for my entire life, I have struggled to keep my household clean and tidy on a consistent basis.
There are always phases when everything is left lying around, and then every now and then I get the urge to tidy up and clean.
But it's actually never the case that "someone could spontaneously come to visit."
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhere but most of the time household chores simply lose out to work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with a child?
We don't have one yet but are working on it and this question has been bothering me for a while.
Because for me, I have no motivation, it just doesn't bother me that much, as long as no visitors are coming and, for example, there is always fresh clothing available and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child provide greater motivation or does one remain sloppy?
Looking forward to your responses.
I would like to give away a voucher code.
just like with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers.
Does that work for you?
Volcanic eruption in La Palma: probably the longest in history.
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused extensive damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, which lasted 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data available on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still dare not predict when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
"The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV station RTVE.
Damages amounting to millions.
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the lava, which is over 1000 degrees hot, has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That's equivalent to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated to be more than 900 million Euros.
Off the coast, two new land tongues, with a combined size of about 50 hectares, were formed by cooled lava.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly depend, was particularly hard hit. It was already in crisis even before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and further areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clunky for that and not suitable for my taste.
For that, I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping itself take?
We don't need to have discussions here about which dish is better, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And therefore, both have their names.
In English, an equivalent might be something like the "twist," which doesn't sound nearly as appetizing.

An unworthy end to a career: Räikkönen has to give up.
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight contact with the barrier, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo not even halfway through the race distance at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the premier class of motorsport.
For the farewell, his wife Minttu and their two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Raikkonen's greatest achievement was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position, and made it onto the podium 103 times. dpa
If it's not possible, I would also be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
Under certain circumstances, I might find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 Euros for goods that I don't need is a bit too much.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro dividers, it can be adjusted according to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible equipment setup could be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a flash attachment.
Larger DSLM cameras, like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2, still leave room for additional lenses.
Additionally, you can store a lot of accessories.
And anyone who has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photographic items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack provides ample space for a DJI Mavic Pro, including remote control and accessories.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Yes, it's the F-parts.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is supported by two feet..unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't assemble the bed.
The middle beam is supported by two feet, unfortunately, these have been produced defectively.
The center bar does not fit into the intended bracket.
So, I will get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent off?
No, no flats.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the correct ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't really matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose.
They are not flat with me.
Could I have this sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
I have already cut my finger.
That is an absolute outrage.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver who appreciates reliability and safety when braking, even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made from cast iron and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All tuned windows are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are unique to certain windows and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created, which is aimed at balancing the disc according to the properties of the original assembly.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the cutouts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic qualities of our tuned windows enhance the character of every car with their attractive and striking appearance.
I fundamentally believe that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I believe it is good for older siblings to take care of the younger ones in moderation.
Just quickly check, just quickly help, just bring the bottle etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are included.
As long as they can still be a child themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your child is able to entertain themselves for a short time and they are okay with it, then that's good.
You can best judge whether this is suitable for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to swaddle K2 and accompany him for hours until he falls asleep.
From a legal standpoint, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that's where the psychologist's statement comes from.
Because if something were to actually happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion etc., it would indeed be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether that's a risk you want to take is, of course, up to your discretion ;)
Yes, I already reported a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have sought legal advice again and have therefore contacted you again.
We originally reached out half a year ago.
But at the top edge of the wooden part, there are two deep notches that have been filled with something yellow.
And on the mirror itself, there is a small scratch.
I have another question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in oversized, like 240/240 for example?
Hello dear #PRS_ORG# team,
I have already contacted you under the customer contact number #PHONENUMBER#.
Thank you for the message.
But why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
The protein ingested with the food is broken down by the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into individual protein components (amino acids), and from these it builds up its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation in the nestling and the feather regeneration in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high demand on the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as it can otherwise lead to disruptions in the breeding process.
Following this course-like administration of NEKTON-Bio, one should return to daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement).

1 g of NEKTON-Bio in 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
One leveled scoop (included) equals 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In cases of severe feather damage, double or triple the dose of NEKTON-Bio can be administered initially, until the onset of new feather growth is visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose is administered until the feather regrowth is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, without exposure to sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Iran sees progress in negotiations over nuclear agreement.
According to Iranian reports, progress is emerging in the negotiations for a revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development," because initially there wasn't even consensus on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after a nearly one-week interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
I have already written, didn't you receive my text message?
The email for cancellation was sent on 12/26/#NUMBER#.
By the way, twice.
However, it was not confirmed.
Not everyone has the time for your ridiculous chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you correct and not everyone from our household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
I can only briefly open a book, as soon as I look at something else then I can no longer read the book and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and find the place up to where I have read.
On Saturday, I have already communicated with you once before.
Hello, I wanted to order something and noticed after a few days that I forgot the last step in the payment process.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or if it will ever come again?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Yes, that is really easier!
Then let's do it that way!
Could you send me the return label by email?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut's daughter and presenter into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host, and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of Blue Origin, a company founded by Amazon's Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliantly blue sky, Bezos personally greeted the newly minted astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Amid the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were in transit for ten minutes and thirteen seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor of the company. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each of them paid for their ticket.
After the short flight, Laura Shepard Churchley reflected on her father's mission.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his assignments.
"She just flew along for the ride," said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed enthusiasm.
He would most like to return to space immediately, said the host.
"New Shepard" flies up to a height of 100 kilometers.
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule, which was detached from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, experiencing periods of weightlessness, before the reusable object landed again, slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the earth as the boundary to space, however, there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned space trip by Blue Origin: On the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
In the second one in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
The DDR handicraft model old building E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway enthusiast ME issue 11/1968, used with signs of play and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn Society (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working condition.
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn Society commissioned AEG to propose an electric locomotive that should be able to transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a travel speed of 45 km/h on this route.
A maximum speed of 65 km/h was required.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery of a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive, AEG with the delivery of the mechanical parts, and Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical parts.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
All survived the Second World War and found themselves in the territory of what would later become East Germany.
In 1946, the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
In the Reichsbahn repair shop in Dessau, it was determined that all six locomotives were worthy of refurbishment.
As the re-electrification of the Central German network progressed, resulting in an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
Initially, the E 04, E 44, and E 94, which were available in larger quantities, were primarily assembled.
Only when it became apparent that the number of E 94s could not be further increased, did the E 95s come into the focus of the reprocessing.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They arrived at the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own circulation plan before coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig, and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
It often happened that shooters would get stuck during switching operations.
Then, the brakeman who was constantly riding on this locomotive had to release the shooters with a hammer and wooden wedge during the journey.
Damage to the drive motors occurred frequently and led to months-long failures of the locomotive.
Since there were enough new locomotives available by the end of the 1960s, and a significant expansion of electric operations was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the fragmented types, so the E 95 were taken out of service.
Additionally, they faced the issue that the German Reichsbahn wanted to staff electric locomotives with only one person, which would have caused problems in train operations due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility conditions from the driver's cab.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were decommissioned in mid-1969, the last to follow them was the E 95 01, which retired from service on October 5, 1970.
The intended new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all the locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system at the main Halle train station.
It took some time before the officials at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external restoration of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
The locomotive is museum-maintained at the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Traditional Community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Arnstadt Museum Railway Depot with a new interior and exterior paint job. The transformers were checked and five drive motors are operational.
The locomotives were in operation until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching side lines, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia.
Handmade model H0 in original packaging, function is good, optical rework on the locomotive is necessary, dusty, with signs of play, basement smell!!!, very rare handmade model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
The packaging may show labels and signs of storage.
If you extend the voucher for me, I will place a larger order immediately, but after all, I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And the fact that the past year turned out differently than expected, I could not foresee and therefore was not able to resolve and clarify it in a timely manner.
But I, as a customer, am the one who suffers the damage and I do not accept this.
Is it then foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
Extra stress before holiday and holiday-weekends.
This topic came up for me last week.
But now, I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why only now a post about it.
Not only before big holidays, like Christmas, do we experience a lot of stress in our operation.
It seems that it also exists before holidays and bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, the vast majority of people and businesses take a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So, last week there was a long 4-day weekend coming up.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Loads of emails that absolutely had to be sent out before Ascension Day, order here, order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... well, because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that can't be allowed?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also extremely annoyed.
What is this self-flagellation about holidays?
Why do we even have holidays if we're not allowed to properly enjoy them?!
The stress, mind you, did not come from above, the colleagues were all independently like that.
My question is simply: Is it just us, the Swiss, who are like this?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you also know this in the North?
Perfect, that matches up :) Do I need to add anything else?
Do you just need the tracking number for my email?
Companies are paying vaccination premiums and changing advertising slogans.
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees cash bonuses for getting vaccinated.
With this, they are in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, who today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The redesign of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German model - is intended to increase the willingness to get COVID-19 vaccinations.
Back then, I already had a huge problem with you when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# dresser.
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I have sent off an application.
Today, the invitation for a conversation arrived via email.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter," but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background from, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I just don't want to step on any official's toes.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for it.
When did the deadline expire?
According to the Distance Selling Act, I have a right of withdrawal for 1 month.
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly celebration.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something enticing about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of indigenous peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Saint Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely associated the Christmas holidays with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were presented in one way or another on St. Nicholas' Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as the Bishop of Myra, is said to have secretly thrown gold into the window of three women in one night, in order to spare them a further life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the popular tradition in Germany of filling the boots, especially those of children, with gifts emerged.
Protestants took issue with this custom because they reject intermediaries between God and people as "saint worship."
For these reasons, they object to the institution.
Martin Luther transformed Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child, thereby establishing a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer view such detailed questions so strictly, only a few are still annoyed that the tradition of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martin's tradition with Martin's singing and Martin's parade, is still a firm part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today, you can find everything your heart desires in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries.
Sources confirm a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on Saint Nicholas' Day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christian-influenced countries, there is a cheerful confusion about the question of who actually brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is essentially a type of Saint Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
This includes, for example, his white bushy beard, which has little in common with the rather stern Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the chimney to gain access to houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost has brought some fame.
Here, it's not reindeer, but three horses, that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the homeland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the delivery of gifts.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
Yes, I believe that, but the question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?
Planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I've been in the ref since summer, I enjoy teaching, but I'm currently still having major problems planning my geography lessons in a time-efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not well-equipped technologically, so in principle, I can only use the blackboard, the textbook, and an overhead projector as mediums.
In school, I can only copy in black and white for free, which is annoying for geography.
Currently, I just need a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently dealing with the topic of geofactors and for me, each hour stands on its own.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (which I also need for other tasks and so on).
When planning, I always start with the learning objective (what do I want to achieve) and then consider how I can build it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence, the worksheets.
Perhaps a geography teacher can show me how to work with the book in a time-efficient manner.
I would really appreciate it.
Career in social work - as someone with an avoidant personality disorder?
I have completed training in software development and have now been fully qualified for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering for some time to start over and study social work.
The problem: I have an avoidant (or fearfully avoidant) personality disorder (APD).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I've been told several times that I seem unapproachable (although I believe that has improved).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't really want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family assistance.
However, I don't know if the actual workday is really as I imagine it to be, and it's difficult to find anything about it on the internet.
The AVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it brings me down every time there is something to criticize about my code ("messed up the simplest things again") and I find it hard to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm keeping him from his work with my stupid questions"/"he must really think I'm incompetent" etc.).
I will probably encounter these problems in any profession, but I wanted to mention it at this point.
I requested a return label for my order #NUMBER# last week and again this morning.
I was told that one will be sent to me.
Since I have not received one yet (not even in the SPAM folder), I wanted to ask how long this usually takes.
Many thanks.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "At Home".
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" at the sold-out Blue Note on Friday, and also served as the moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast, and listens sensitively to the nightly sounds at her front door.
I received my order today, unfortunately, it is entirely a different color, plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has a mark.
The color was exactly as shown on the website in the first delivery.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we exchange the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The item cost less than 20 Euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a major customer of #PRS_ORG#, so it's not a problem for me.
I just need a number or instruction on what I should include with the package so it can be tracked as a return by you.
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller novel a few years ago and although I can still recall almost the entire plot, I just can't remember the title no matter how hard I try. Maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by covering himself with food and going into the enclosure with his predatory cats.
The case is taken over by a female commissioner who, after a brief investigation, suspects his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides occurring and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before each suicide to go to the scene of the suicide, document it, and post the photos on the internet.
In any case, it ultimately turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain, forcing patients to confront their fears in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of the window, another intentionally drives herself to death)
Facing this fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had something to do with a fire.
That's the rough plot, I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone is familiar with this action or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Something completely different: I noticed back in school that many religious education teachers do not believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
For me, that was always a bit strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and so I always somehow believed.
What is your opinion on this?
Perhaps you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Fundamentally, I understand the difference between private and professional, and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum and so on.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What then motivates someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
Preserve culture or something like that?
Hope your question is not too private.
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?

Car skids into tree: Driver fatally injured.
The 53-year-old crashed his car into a central reservation on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten for an unknown reason, and subsequently ended up on the opposite lane, as reported by the police.
There, it came to a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then hurled against a tree, trapping the man inside the vehicle.
The 27-year-old, as well as his 23-year-old passenger, were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim.
At least you could rely on youngster Johannes Patrick.
Again, nothing: For the second time in less than three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick, reflecting on the cup defeat in early October against Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
That did not subside after the game - instead, it increased even more in light of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
More than the bare result, it was the manner of the performance that was disappointing.
To illustrate, let's mention a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point rate was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) out of a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
The answer was provided by John Patrick: "After the victory at Tenerife, we simply weren't focused enough and didn't implement what we had trained for."
Namely, to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "Winning a thrilling game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like being in front of 10,000 people."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe-Arena, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and directed his team's game.
"The best playmaker I have ever trained," Gleim praised further.
While in Patrick's team, even the key players like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total debacle and managed to get within eight points, after they had already been trailing 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time left for despair.
Already on Wednesday (7 pm), the Giants will host the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
I had already given everything to her colleague, Semina or similar.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was responded to my concern.
I always have to work in between and answer the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
It doesn't help much, as I have been waiting for it since September.
Is the full amount refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
To ensure the paint application is even and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry.
Before you apply the brush to the model with a new color for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component.
Draw the brush evenly, stroke by stroke.
A slight overlap of the color layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid quickly swiping back and forth with the brush.
This results in surfaces that appear unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones could otherwise show through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors are applied last with a separate brush.
Otherwise, there may be unsightly metal streaks if they mix with regular colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you assemble them.
The models achieve an authentic appearance through the decals or transfer stickers.
From national emblems on airplanes, ship names, to trim lines and license plates on car models: The decals give the model the final touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easily accessible.
An airplane cockpit can be more easily covered before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks, when applying stickers, are time, patience, and a steady hand.
Cut out each required decal individually and arrange them as needed.
Decals are also called water slide images because you moisten their backside briefly with water until the backing paper becomes dark due to the dampness.
Then you slide the picture just a little bit off the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the backing paper away sideways.
Caution: Always check first if the picture is properly positioned before you completely slide it off the paper, to prevent it from sticking to your finger, wrinkling, or even tearing.
Absorb excess water with a household cloth.
Caution not suitable for children under 3 years old.
But you have already received the sofa back, haven't you?
Because there was no confirmation for that.
I already had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
To put it quite clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this broadcaster are now absolutely terrible.
Almost every format is sponsored (which is fine), but then they also go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that they were an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Arno's quote: "We don't want to be a walking advertising pillar."
What is one now?
A run-of-the-mill advertising channel trying to peddle its cheap merchandise to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
The rules apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they are still allowed to insult people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to profit at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How is one supposed to like all of this?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
Tire choice for racing bikes - really that puncture-proof?
This morning, I woke up full of energy because I wanted to do at least a little training in preparation for my bike tour next week.
Said and done, I set off on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what lurks in every city center happened (this time: thanks Krefeld!).
Glass shards on the track.
Suddenly, a loud hissing sound and my rear tire absolutely refused to continue the rest of the journey.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and spare tube due to the day of the week, I had to turn around in a somewhat bad mood and take the first available train home.
Mood-wise, it wasn't all that bad, maybe it's even better if I practice changing the tire again before the bike tour.
But now I am faced with a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long journey over several days ahead of me, I would be extremely reluctant to encounter this problem frequently.
Now it really wasn't bad, as the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had ridden 120km by 2pm on the day I came to pick up the bike!) were also included, and he had already described them as suboptimal because he had been riding them on rollers for several years.
But when I think about having to change a tire after driving 80-90kms, I believe I would really be in a bad mood :D.
Now, I've struck up a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me, puzzled, why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now, of course, all of this sounds very tempting.
But are these really so indestructible?
I have little desire to spend 40€ per tire now, only to end up being disappointed.
Furthermore, I wonder: I think I currently have 25x622 on my racing bike.
These do exist (apparently?) with the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me to get different tires for a racing bike?
The Schwalbe page seems to recommend the Durano DD according to my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thanks in advance for the help and best wishes!
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from their support.

The freight company has announced they will make contact to arrange the collection of the incorrectly delivered table.
So far, I have not received any message.
I request immediate processing.
I am now writing to the third support staff member, and with none of them have I gotten further than the promise that I will receive an email confirmation.

The tabletop for 8 people was delivered instead of the one for 6 people.

The "drive" of a tube power amplifier significantly contributes to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust both the desired level and the distortion content of your sounds.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows one to reduce the sound level without changing anything about the "gain" and distortion.
It was hinted earlier that with the POWER LEVEL control, you can even mobilize a power reserve when things get outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that even when using headphones or direct recordings, you get a distinctly "acoustic" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX port, allowing you to jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuning device.
Those who additionally invest in a VFS5 footswitch can conveniently call up the sounds with their foot, switch the effect blocks on/off, and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new powerhouses, VOX is taking another step into the future!
All Bosch electric tools, pneumatic tools, and measuring tools are carefully checked, tested, and subject to the strict controls of Bosch's quality assurance.
Therefore, Bosch provides a warranty for Bosch power tools, pneumatic tools, and measuring tools.
The buyer's warranty claims from the purchase contract with the seller, as well as statutory rights, are not limited by this guarantee.
We provide a warranty for these tools according to the following conditions:
We provide a warranty in accordance with the following provisions (Nos. 2 - 7) by rectifying defects in the tool free of charge, which are demonstrably due to a material or manufacturing defect within the warranty period.
The warranty period is 24 months, for commercial or professional use or equivalent stress, it is 12 months.
The warranty period begins with the purchase by the first buyer.
The decisive factor is the date on the original purchase receipt.
For all commercial, blue power tools and measuring tools (with the exception of high-frequency tools, industrial battery screwdrivers, and pneumatic tools) purchased after September 1, 2004, the warranty period is extended to 36 months if the buyer registers these tools within 4 weeks of the purchase date.
Battery packs and chargers, as well as included accessories, are excluded from this warranty extension.
Registration can only be done online at www.bosch-pt.com/warranty.
The registration receipt, which must be printed out immediately, and the original purchase receipt, which shows the date of purchase, serve as confirmation.
Registration is only possible if the buyer agrees to the storage of the data they enter there.
Excluded from the warranty are: parts that are subject to wear and tear due to use or other natural wear, as well as defects in the tool that are due to use-related or other natural use, abnormal environmental conditions, improper operating conditions, overload, or lack of maintenance or care.
Defects in the tool caused by the use of accessory, supplementary, or replacement parts that are not original Bosch parts.
Tools that have been modified or supplemented.
Minor deviations from the intended condition, which are irrelevant for the value and usability of the tool.
The rectification of the defect that we recognize as being under warranty is carried out in such a way that we, at our discretion, repair the defective tool free of charge or replace it with a flawless tool (possibly also a successor model).
Replaced tools or parts become our property.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered only at the beginning of June?
You can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various pieces of furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after several months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, a 24-month warranty applies.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Difficult "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution.
What on earth is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, submitted by a resident of Amberg, caused intense reflection in the BR television show "We in Bavaria."
However, unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unguessed by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous."
And also none for whom "everything must go quickly."
That, the people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
Upon which the man from Amberg shared the solution, likely causing surprise among many Upper Palatians.
"The Huidlerer," the viewers learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
With which an educational gap was closed - probably also for several people who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1.
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on German Sky has been decreasing, so with this post I want to vent a little.
Firstly, the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race today, in order to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and the start accident had significantly set back the schedule, they could have still shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, it seems that for legal reasons, F1 takes precedence and therefore everything else must be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcasted the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes handled the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident well.
Then, there was once again a lack of knowledge about the rules in F1 among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you are allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen could change tires when there were corresponding radio messages on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that this possibility exists for Verstappen.
In my opinion, one should simply know such basic rules if they are commenting on F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first time they are guessing what is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties about the rules.
In general, I don't like the contrived commentary style of Roos, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But honestly, I even prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL.
This is accompanied by constant silliness, which makes both seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest to the comment, as he apparently does not take it seriously.
Not least, advertising simply gets out of hand on Sky, in the final round Sky is the only broadcaster that goes to commercials, as you can hear on F1TV since only the German audio track has to do without commentary right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two stations do less advertising during training than Sky, even though they are free-to-air channels.
While one must commend Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very sparse and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts F1.
Unironically, apart from the advertisements, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
At least, the grandiose F1 season is much less enjoyable than it would be with a decent broadcaster.
I would be interested in hearing your opinion.
I submitted the contact form yesterday for the return of an item, but I have not received an email confirmation or anything similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - the Free State is now the federal state with the highest Covid-19 incidence rate.
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thuringia was the only federal state with a COVID-19 incidence rate above 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value at 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which recently had the highest incidence nationwide, this value was at 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but it was also above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths related to an infection were reported within a day.
On Sunday, 200 severely ill Covid-19 patients were treated in intensive care units in hospitals.
There may be reporting delays on weekends.
In addition, the health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are barely keeping up with the recording of new cases.
Please send me any transaction number.. or anything else that could help.
Transfer confirmation... etc
It's time for changes.
Greetings to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What's the purpose of this post here?
If one looks at the activity in the Bundestag over the past few months, one thing can be determined: it is non-existent.
We have fallen into a winter hibernation and have extended the summer lull for several months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the reason?
For the most part, this is likely simply due to dissatisfaction with how some things have been handled here and how we generally appear.
In recent days, the impression has increasingly emerged that many people here are genuinely still interested in the Federal Parliament.
What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag, who wants to keep it alive, is asked.
The initiative came from u/edizVEVO, who became aware of this project in recent days and, simply put, found a mess.
After some back and forth communication, several people from the community have been found who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, as this is the only way this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with each other, as well as work out specific things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:1.
How should the Bundestag function in the future?
Which existing orders need to be changed / adjusted / removed?
How should we present ourselves externally in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a few things, but that's not a problem, that's what we have Discord for in the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, collaborate with us and let's democratically decide about the future.
What you're describing is referred to as *awareness*, meaning sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
The most common occurrence is hearing noises/voices, less frequently seeing images, and the least common is experiencing pain.
Relevant to this topic: Cesarean sections are surgeries that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
Dear all, although this comment of mine accurately describes awareness, by definition, u/Nitemarex did not have any.
I misread your comment.
Why is the shipping only starting on March 16th?
There was no mention of such a long delivery time on your website.
Chat connection is gone, what now?
I also have to work in between!
Good day!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy it from you and pay in Euros?
It is the #PRS_ORG# day cover in blue-green.
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, before the purchase, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
We did nothing with the chair.
Suddenly, the crack was there.
I just sat on it.
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, however, I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I don't have suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cupboard as much as possible for pickup - you will need to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pickup appointment.
Our little one has been sleeping on her stomach since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can endure much more than one might think.
Make sure that everything around is right, no stuffed animals, go in and check often, but no minute-by-minute surveillance.
That drives you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when they sleep.
Is it turning its head to the side?
Can it lift itself up from the belly?
Or is it lying face down directly on the mattress?
From this, you can deduce whether everything is okay.
We all grew up and when my husband was born, for example, it was common practice to lay the kids on their stomach to sleep.
So, I want to send the lamp back.
What is the best way to proceed?

Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far, nothing.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email, and she never responded.
Where you can still get Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and the gifts.
Have you not procured any poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
To achieve an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass virtually distortion-free and without color errors up to the edge zone.
Magnifying glasses are often marked with magnification specifications.
However, these details only apply to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To make optimal use of your magnifying glass, we ask you to pay attention to the information in the "Technical Data" table (see the user manual in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - including magnifying glasses.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
When adhering to optimal usage conditions - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further instructions can be found in the accompanying user manual (available in both German and English).

Darmstadt is second after the first half of the season - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf.
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Football Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the bottom of the table.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt even under the third coach.
Celebration in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top match, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
What happens now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English may not be as good anymore, but I can manage that.
Alright.
We will not place any more orders with them.
If you add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you have obviously lost a good customer.
You are welcome to pass this on to your manager.
That is not competitive.
Does the cabinet need to be completely disassembled for pickup and refund?
And when would the pickup be?
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the refund was initiated, and now you're telling me that I have to send the item back first.
It's not my fault that the dresser arrived completely damaged at my place.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written.
It clearly states that the refund was initiated and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of, and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations, however, I synchronized, removed, and reloaded the app, NOTHING worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because the whole operation has already cost me a lot of time and I'm now hoping for help.
To debunk fake news - BioNTech CEO releases vaccination photo.
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn".
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously publicly commented on his vaccination status.
The entrepreneur has now published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend prompted him to do so, Şahin shared.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There were false information on social media claiming that I supposedly was not vaccinated.
"Indeed, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the network "LinkedIn."
"For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected this because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe case of Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family are not vaccinated, Şahin further wrote.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it's better to share personal experiences instead.
An interview is circulating on the internet with Deutsche Welle in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"Currently, I am legally not allowed to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization in Germany for the vaccination of the vaccine.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and according to his own statements, the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times.
The 110-kV underground cable will be newly constructed in 2022.
The permit for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable near Tann is legally binding.
The planning approval decision by the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction, which is set to begin in 2022.
This was recently announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning at Reut.
That's exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I'm writing to you.
I would like to please take over the return at my own expense.
Charging 8 euros for a return fee is, in my eyes, an outrage.
The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining a digital decoder and sound module on a circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm, and thus it can be installed in almost any locomotive of the H0 and 0 gauge tracks.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker including a sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
He is proficient in the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are as common as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically register themselves at a suitable digital control center.
He masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, CV values can be read on the main track with suitable control centers.
For central units that can only program CVs from 1-255, auxiliary registers exist.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving stages at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses allow the triggering of 16 functions.
An integrated programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration on mfx®-compatible central units.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes Märklin® braking sections as well as ZIMO® HLU braking commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake modules or with direct current is also possible.
Furthermore, he also stops at a Selectrix® braking diode.
An ABC pendulum automatic system allows for automatic commuting between two train stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog direct and alternating current railways.
Often on tour and still have a lot of equipment with you?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
A 20-liter capacity can easily accommodate larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you need in everyday items, thanks to practical access points, remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design is literally packed with features - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to the photo equipment.
This works in two ways: Once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with the messenger bags.
Inside the closure flap, there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered various "fill levels": there are in fact 4 anchor bars, sturdily riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top beam, if it's rather empty, take a lower one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be securely closed without engaging the hook.
The second feature that fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other camera backpacks is that in addition to the lid flap, there is also a zippered opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly enhances the everyday usability of the backpack: especially if you're not only carrying your photography equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more on that below) and thus easily store both separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
This way, you can also pull the backpack from the right side to the front of your body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items remain safely in the left half of the backpack and do not get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even if you're planning to go to Scotland in the fall.
Hello, I just saw that display case #NAME# is sold out.
That's very unfortunate.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been completely removed from the range?
Is there a possibility to order this display case in another country?
Statement of a community worker in contradiction to the statute.
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be cut down on our property.
So, a request for a permit has been submitted to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees, and thus also the walnut, is not part of the statute.
However, the walnut tree is explicitly stated as a tree to be protected in the statute.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is indeed clear.
I appreciate your responses.
Holetschek: States discuss the abolition of testing requirements for those who have been vaccinated three times.
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the testing requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times at their next meeting.
"We, as countries, need clarity quickly on whether and from when the testing requirement can be dropped for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The abolition of the 2G plus rule for those who have been vaccinated three times is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on this matter as early as next Tuesday." - afp
It's a pity, I received it as a gift and it's too small :(
Stages in the career of the new world champion Verstappen.
The Dutchman Max Verstappen is the new Formula 1 World Champion.
Max Verstappen has made it.
The Dutchman clinches his first World Championship title in his seventh year in Formula 1 with Red Bull.
His journey to the pinnacle of the premier class:
Abu Dhabi - 2012, Italy: Verstappen loses the Kart World Championship after a crash in Sarno.
Father Jos Verstappen leaves him annoyed at a gas station on the return journey.
His mother, Sophie Kumpen, picks up the teenager in the car following behind.
2014, England: Red Bull's junior team gets a promising newcomer in Verstappen.
The 16-year-old is thus following in the footsteps of Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo.
At that time, he initially continued in the European Formula 3.
2015, Australia: At the age of 17 years and 166 days, Verstappen starts as the youngest pilot in history in a Grand Prix.
Due to a defect, he has to park his Toro Rosso prematurely in Melbourne.
2015, Malaysia: The then Toro-Rosso driver Verstappen, at 17 years and 180 days old, is also the youngest racer to score points in Formula 1.
Verstappen finished in seventh place at the Grand Prix of Malaysia in Sepang.
2016, Spain: In his first race for Red Bull, Verstappen wins immediately.
At 18 years and 228 days old, he becomes sensationally the youngest Grand Prix winner in Formula 1 history in Barcelona.
2019, Hungary: Verstappen celebrates his first pole position in Budapest - he is not the youngest.
At 21 years old, he leaves behind Valtteri Bottas and his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton.
2021, Abu Dhabi: The summit has been reached.
At the age of 24, Verstappen celebrates his first World Championship title at the Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi - with an overtaking maneuver against Hamilton in the final lap. dpa
I just didn't receive it and therefore couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he had expired, which really annoyed me.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and thus we could check beforehand if it matches in color.
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest-growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer seeking wealth in the West and wanting to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers apparently have the same idea!
You must outperform your pioneer colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources, and build a tableau that increasingly "works" for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions, or bend the rules in your favor.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual play style through fine adjustments.
Coloma spans over a period of three years from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), to 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a lock!
This deactivates one half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then, the players take turns performing actions, such as gaining resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunslingers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the start of each round, the promoter turns to a new location, thereby changing the available actions.
This continues until the promoter has moved five times, thus covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lesser rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I will take the shipping method, merchandise shipment (games wrapped in foil), up to the dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
For everything else, usually DPD insured and with shipment tracking (games wrapped in foil, wrapped in fleece and packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can also send the item double-boxed for an additional charge of 2 Euros, to ensure that there are absolutely no pressure marks.
In the name of the people: Laypeople make judgments.
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothes on the judge's bench.
Yet, their judgment carries a lot of weight, even if they don't wear robes: Lay judges, together with professional judges, determine if and for how long someone goes behind bars.
Two of them, in conversation with the "Public", recount their time at the Bad Kreuznach District Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the District Court on John F. Kennedy Street.
I'd be happy to, I had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and received it. Therefore, because they are so nice, I would now like one in grey.
Yes, what I don't understand is, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I already ordered in November.
Here it is: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multicolored glass x 1.
But I had seen it like that with others.
Is there then the possibility to send the lamp back?
Because it hangs too low over the dining table?
So, I would then like to send them back.
Can you help me with this?
It's a shame, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher is not credited to me, then I will not order anymore out of principle.
If you change your mind, please let me know.
Otherwise, that was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.
During the lockdown, no hardware store is open anyway.....
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she doesn't have any gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing is, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, you can simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer to Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the spirit of the festival by baking cookies and doing crafts with her son.
"I love this," said Catterfeld.
Until the contemplative days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I still don't have any gifts, I need to finally get started."
Ok, thanks anyway!
Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is returned.
But can I get it back without any problems?
But the chair is broken.
Unfortunately, the 20 euros won't help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is not only a legal obligation but also a standard in the eCommerce sector.
Please check again if you could at least take back the broken chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
There, we also lose quite a bit of money.
Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
That's like when someone from the AfD (Alternative for Germany) says they have nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of anti-Semitic messages.
If one wants to distance themselves, they should just completely stop.
Well then, you're about as credible as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the fundamentals of evolution is simply completely lost.
For all I care, a God set the whole thing in motion.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just spouting nonsense.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously, just like Kollegah.
But it arrives much later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again.
Firstly, thank you for taking on this whole matter. I also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, meaning we were also armed in the executive branch, but I don't want to elaborate further!
I always find the question of left and right to be overly simplified.
Fundamentally, one should say that, of course, the civil servant comes more from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, this should actually be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that uniforms and weapons naturally attract people who are to the right of conservative. It should also be clear that these people can struggle with the lived reality, because in addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women, and homosexuals (and by this I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine stereotype, because there are fewer or none of these in the executive branch, but rather ordinary men and women who you wouldn't know are gay unless they tell you). I can and must rely on these people, because in a pinch, they could save your life or risk theirs for you.
But even these marginalized groups, as strange as it may sound at first, in my experience, hold a conservative stance, meaning they are proud of Germany and feel less catered to by exaggerated left-wing politics, even though this politics supposedly advocates for them or thinks it needs to please them. All they want is to be treated normally.
Back to the rights, since the police and armed forces are naturally a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right-wing individuals there. However, the idea that they are allowed to openly express their opinions there, or even openly forge plans that endanger the state, is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that especially police officers and soldiers, who were often deployed abroad, start to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that like-minded individuals with right-wing views meet to engage in lively intellectual exchanges.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, such things are well combated and counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so deeply entwined internationally, and in my opinion, that's a good thing, that we couldn't afford to have real racists and Nazis among us at all!
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I, or Mrs. #NAME#, would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order for the #PRS_ORG# nightstand, and a return label.
This email has not arrived yet.
I want to bring the package to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me.
Kind regards
Good day - I am interested in the Boone dining table, white.
Is it also available in large 230cm?
And the dresser?
Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# right to the room.
How can I book this?
Please proceed with the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I am taking a screenshot.
When will you get in touch?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed via email on 01/18 that the refund was made.
But until today, the money has not arrived with me.
Would you please check there.
Furthermore, we are already a "regular customer" with you and have already purchased many items.
But why are you only offering me 20EUR then?
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
Just this day left, just this week left, just until XY...
Hello lovely, wonderful girls and women,
I have a few things that I just want to write down, and maybe one or two others feel the same way...
I'm 24, have C-PTSD, a full-time student, and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's essentially my child in every other way.
My friend (we've been together for 6 years) is sick, he got a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I too have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because his hand is bandaged due to a burn).
On top of that, he has a cold and we are seeing each other less frequently (1-2 times a week), which is really hard for me given my needs for affection and love.
My fur baby just has a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there for him with the heat lamp and petting.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and the latter is away for a month.
Now we also have housework coming our way, which we will naturally divide among ourselves.
But even cooking is currently a lot of work for me...
My PTSD condition is currently well-managed, I am reasonably well treated and getting by.
Not good, but I'm managing and almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (from me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet, and the day after tomorrow I have an anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week, I have an oral exam right on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no more room.
So my week goes like this: Just until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then the whole thing continues, right?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental anchors, otherwise I can't handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't manage it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinitely grateful, I can't even put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I believe this also has partly to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought I would surely find fellow sufferers here...
I definitely wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
Due to Omicron: Johnson wants to accelerate booster vaccination.
The continuous emergence of Omicron cases is worrying politicians and scientists in the United Kingdom.
Therefore, by New Year's, all qualifying adults in England should receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to progress faster with the Covid-19 booster vaccinations in light of rapidly increasing Omicron numbers than previously aimed for.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
So far, the target date was set for the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
Facing the Omicron variant, we are dealing with an emergency, which is why it is urgent to strengthen vaccination protection, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third vaccine dose.
"Get your booster now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 additional Omicron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, that was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
I can no longer make purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Ad: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping through the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer is possible.
I have updated the account information.
What could be the reason for this?
The decorative light blends harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden.
The lamp is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum illumination duration: 10 hours.
The robust plastic design can be used outdoors all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow brightly from within.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: The sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or colored light (in six different color tones).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn, or in the rock garden.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he knows how to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparatory work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" requires neither a power supply nor batteries.
Place the "luminous stone" in any spot that is exposed to sunlight during the day.
Two included ground spikes ensure a firm hold if needed.
The matte white plastic casing itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module is discreetly hidden inside the "Smart Stone", along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the casing.
As dusk falls, "Smart Stone" automatically begins to glow; you can choose the color yourself: In addition to daylight white, you have a choice of six attractive light colors.
The device also automatically turns off once the battery level has dropped to a predetermined minimum or when it becomes light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts over the next day.
Okay, it is what it is.
I would like to order 3 articles from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date during the ordering process?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that.
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of molting and feather regeneration.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg of biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage occurring in bird keeping can be attributed solely to nutritional errors.
Since feathers consist of protein-rich substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet is required for the formation of a flawless plumage in birds.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large portion of animal losses that occur during molting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the use of NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin supplement should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
After my voucher, which did not reach me due to a complaint, is no longer being generously extended, I will place my order worth approximately.
Remove #NUMBER#€ from my shopping cart and order elsewhere, where customer service is prioritized and I don't have to type my fingers to the bone to achieve absolutely nothing!!
What am I supposed to do with this number then??
The trade industry fears for the Christmas business due to the 2G regulation.
Only those who are vaccinated or have recovered are allowed into most stores.
The trade sector considers this unnecessary and laments a decline in sales.
He also has a possible solution ready.
From the perspective of the German Retail Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are spoiling the important Christmas business for the retail sector.
Sales declines are to be lamented in businesses dealing with non-daily necessities, criticized HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies have a negative outlook for the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year, is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Merchants with 2G access restrictions reportedly lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Things are only going well in the food retail sector and in the online area.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe affair, said the CEO.
""2G at shopping does not advance us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deter customers and require a high level of staff involvement.
He demanded that the ribbon regulation be allowed nationwide.
Afterwards, each customer only needs to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and with the received wristband, they would have access to all stores on that day.
Additionally, in retail - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, or tested) - random checks should suffice.
The real estate corporation Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level without 2G, and the revenues were at about 90 percent.
"These numbers will certainly drop in the middle of the all-important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions are being sought and approval is being attempted for the centers.
This includes the so-called "ribbon solution", where "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central location in the center once and afterwards - equipped with a wristband similar to those in a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed." dpa
Yes, we have, we have deleted all books, reauthorized everything, and loaded new books.
Which ones?
No matter where I click, I am immediately redirected to your page.
Ah okay, I understand.
Well, thank you again for making it so easy!
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy ♡
I will do #PRS_ORG#, very nice and good service, it took a while to get to a person, but they were great.
Residential fire with two minor injuries and high damage.
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-figure euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
According to the information, two residents were taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The Fürstenfeldbruck criminal investigation department has taken over further investigations.
But generally, it exists in large.
since it is indeed available in large in black.
"Arcane" on Netflix: How good is the "League of Legends" series?
Lots of fantasy, many complicated names, a breathtaking presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced second season?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But that has been working since approximately.
Not anymore for 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also expand.
The new offspring is called SOLO 15 and visually reminds of the great role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitably designed foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no impact on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound quality.
A 10 cm speaker simply isn't capable of producing such high sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and, for her size, extremely impressive and precise.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight increase in treble.
This is common practice with broadband to optimize the increasingly strong bundling of too high frequencies.
Precisely aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with its very clear and fine sound.
When slightly turned outward, the treble range can be reduced, thus creating a warmer sound image.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and astonishingly precise.
The suspiciously low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamics that is unparalleled.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also enhances it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is recommended to consider the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning, in order to incorporate any necessary changes during construction.
For example, if one wants to veneer the casing, the recess of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds additional material.
After all the panels have been cut (for example, at the hardware store), one should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the corresponding location, in order to be able to easily thread the cable through later.
With the help of a router, the speaker opening in the front is now made so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be flush-mounted later.
On the reverse side, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer in order to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive an interruption in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
After that, you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front, and the bottom are now being glued onto these.
In the process, the three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness as needed, for example, if one wants to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them oneself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step of work, the second page will be attached.
After that, all parts of the foot follow, meaning both sides as well as the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or Forstner drill bit makes it easier to create the openings for the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the back wall.
Subsequently, a round cutter is used to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top side of the base plate can also be rounded off with it.
Subsequently, the base plate is firmly glued to the base of the casing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
Next comes the marking and pre-drilling (2.5mm drill) of the screw points of the speaker chassis and the terminal block.
After the casing has been cleaned of sawdust (vacuuming / blowing out), the process of laying the cable begins.
This is most easily achieved through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
In doing so, the entire, uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot up to the terminal opening, leaving about 30 cm protruding there.
In the upper part of the casing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and is also left hanging loosely there.
Subsequently, the crossover is prepared and implemented.
The blueprint of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Assembly Instructions for Solo 15 Crossover.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
Through the 35 mm bass reflex opening, and with a bit of skill, one can drip hot glue onto the opening and thus seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, one can accordingly check the seal.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Subsequently, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and secured with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role here, so the positive wire (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a mat of damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
We used to have a different email address, but I have changed it.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Police shoot suspected bank robber near the royal palace.
On Saturday, an armed man was shot by the police near Kensington Palace in London.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who was said to have gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a weapon.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle, which was able to be stopped by officers shortly after.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene of the crime.
The police did not suspect a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Good day, I have a question about your series from #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools available for purchase, but unfortunately, we cannot find them at your place.
Can you help?
A few days ago, I ordered the #PRS_ORG#... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
Honestly, I find that very annoying.
Do I need to cancel the order and reorder for the better price, or is there another way to get a credit?
Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are selecting the Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced quite a few curious situations during the sale of fir trees.
Once, a man is said to have even gone home without his partner because they couldn't agree.
Every year, he plants about 2000 of them for this purpose.
In the process, the 56-year-old has already experienced quite a few curious situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas period a bit funny, he says.
Always immaculate: Max Raabe turns 59.
He is able to captivate his audience with reinterpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good Day, Dear Happiness" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe had wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But that won't happen.
The planned concert has been rescheduled to May 2022 - "on official orders", to contain the Corona virus.
Other scheduled performances during the Advent season will also have to be cancelled, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists want to make up for their dates that were postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and with pleasure since his teenage years.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchester with his fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded numerous prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For Women, That's No Problem" (2013) - the second place on the charts.
He has managed to move from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with his blonde hair slicked back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is now an indispensable part of the current German-speaking music scene.
He has been on tour with the program "Good Day, Dear Happiness" since 2020. dpa
How do you respond to the question, why are you vegan?
Today, I had a conversation with a colleague whom I like.
She herself lived as a vegetarian for a while, and currently seems to eat meat very rarely.
I myself was also a vegetarian for several years before.
In response to the question of whether I always wanted to be vegan, and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I honestly answered without much thought.
In fact, I long thought that as a vegetarian I would be supporting animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that ultimately, I was also supporting animal cruelty.
Hence my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that she was becoming disgruntled. She then defended vegetarianism, saying she knew where her meat came from and that being a vegetarian reduces animal suffering.
Now I wonder, was my answer too "clumsy"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan, you quickly get cornered and conflicts arise, without you intending for it to happen.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB (German Civil Code).
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no means to store these for so long.
We would use the table as offered by them as if it were ours.

Content Warning: I am going to write somewhat detailed about domestic violence here.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) often come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence due to my profession.
A theme that really gnaws at me and unfortunately occurs far too often is that many victims do not accept help or think we cannot help them.
I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that affect me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a one-on-one conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, perhaps it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of tearing the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even close to tears, is that everyone deserves to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not simply have to accept violence.
Often, I wish I could help in every case... I know that I can't.
But it never gets easier.
Please, always remember, you are worthy of living without violence, this is so incredibly important.
Fertility treatment with private health insurance / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to settling the bill with the private health insurance, they are suddenly being difficult.
In order:1.
We had applied for fertility treatment in advance with the private health insurance and received approval for 3 attempts.
The attempts were in no way limited (e.g. timeframe, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed through private health insurance.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child and made 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but we did not yet settle these with the private health insurance.
We again applied for cost coverage from the private health insurance and were again granted 3 more attempts.
After several more attempts (we conducted more attempts than promised, logically billing the most expensive ones to the private health insurance), we submitted the invoices to the private health insurance and got a nasty surprise: instead of reimbursing for 5 attempts (2+3), the private health insurance only wants to reimburse for 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts from the first commitment are forfeited.
The desire for a second child is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions for the experts in this round here:
Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (5 attempts should be reimbursed)?
Should the private health insurance have had to point out in their promises that with a birth, the further attempts are forfeited?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thank you very much in advance for your help!
"Half victory" against Belarus associated with high costs for the EU.
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Protestant News Service (epd).
The EU has not sustainably resolved the confrontation, stated the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus not entirely backing down, but the EU feeling like the winner - will probably continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not decisively oppose this, it comes at the expense of basic rights.
This development simultaneously weakens the cohesion within the Union.
"She apparently cannot assert herself when a member state decides to do its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to its border.
Furthermore, the EU is paying another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy is being made more difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Repeated attempt at crossing the border.
According to Poland's border patrol, migrants have once again tried to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and taken back to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were reportedly pelted with stones by migrants during the incident near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border patrol registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, as the ruler in Minsk, of having enticed them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have closed off sections of the border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU's response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard-hitting and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus regularly funneling thousands of people through the country.
Is good, thank you.
I expect a response by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Fire in transformer station: Tens of thousands of people without power.
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had crippled a substation.
After a fire caused severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district of North Rhine-Westphalia had to go without electricity for about 24 hours.
Due to the fire on Friday evening, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents in several communities.
The utility company Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power generators were in operation on Saturday until the widespread disruption could finally be completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and both male and female helpers from the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The provider thanked the affected individuals for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
"We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the primary technology department, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damages will take a few more days, as the Westnetz technicians could initially only put some lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Power is back on.
The fire that broke out on Friday around 7:15 PM, according to Westnetz, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switching station in Neunkirchen-Seelscheid.
There, extensive cleaning and repair work would be necessary.
Parallel to this, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been established.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back up.
Since Saturday at 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had power again.
An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9:30 PM onwards.
Since 11:15 PM, even those who were last affected by the power outage have electricity.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
After setting up emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighborhood assistance.
"What is important now is that citizens take care of the elderly or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire departments if help is needed," explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the residents of nursing homes were particularly in focus.
Additionally, according to authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who needed electricity-dependent medical devices or relied on medical care.
Nordic Combined: Riiber wins the combination
The German Nordic Combined skiers Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Estonian Otepää.
The duo had to admit defeat once again to the outstanding Norwegian, Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country skiing with a significant lead after the ski jumping.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I would still like to send them back.
Could you then send the return slips, so I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.
Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
Yet, their life resembles a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers take care of her appearance.
After all, Aniston admits, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: just ONE single chip from the bag).
The fact that she still manages to win the hearts of both female and male fans alike is actually a miracle.
Perhaps because she simply has bad luck with happiness - and is still searching for true love.
And has crossed off the desire for a baby from the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
One can only hope that success and fame also bring happiness.
Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry.
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and I find the subject itself quite interesting. I also don't mind working in the lab (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical).
Of course, I had already informed myself about career prospects before studying, but at that time I also thought that I definitely wanted to, and would, study up to the doctoral level.
However, I am currently having doubts, especially the job prospects are weighing heavily on me.
On one hand (Studycheck etc), you constantly hear about great job opportunities and the profession being in high demand, on the other hand, you constantly hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
So, I would really be interested to know:
What are you currently working as?
Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
What did you study/What training did you undergo?
Would you do it all over again?
Thank you very much for your responses!
I'm really unsure at the moment and considering possibly dropping out of my studies in 2022 to train as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, feel free to write them down :)
I had returned an item via the contact form or initiated a return and wanted to ask if it arrived or is being processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them showed a defect after a relatively short period of time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.

Did you receive this email?
Hello to all,
Finally, we can announce that we are hosting the OSCAST again this year!
For known reasons, unfortunately, we are unable to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people connected remotely, so we will be following the 2021 Oscars with at least 7 people on the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - nevertheless, we will do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start at around 0:30.
Start chilling your drinks, plan some good food, and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.

Do you have a premium customer status?
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euros in black be delivered to Germany, or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany?
I always only find you as a partner company.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than the one I ordered.
Please call me.
The title suggests it, I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
Since these are soon largely completed, I will then partly continue to vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personally related (e.g., "I am taking medication X, is it compatible with the vaccination..").
My responsibilities include providing information about the vaccination, determining eligibility (whether a person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination regulation and there are no reasons against it), medical documentation, and possibly emergency care in case of allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, for example, medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often don't have any, but "only" (by no means a lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who however cannot (are not allowed to?) administer vaccinations, so I end up administering most of the vaccinations myself.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts.
The blue order number: #PRS_ORG# with the tracking number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next steps are?
Have a great start to the week!
I directly bought a book with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I want to open it, the message comes up, oops!
This document could not be opened.
The file may be faulty, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me further?
An exclusive, new, and high-quality cut, anatomically pre-shaped, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit, and thus allows almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, further embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (at the arm and knee bends).
The area covered by the Flex System in the Focea Comfort 4 has been more than doubled compared to the Flex System 2, in order to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, arm and knee bends).
High-quality preforms in the lower back area and in the crotch ensure a snug, perfect fit.
The Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar region increases flexibility around the back zipper, thereby improving comfort, especially when bending over and when mounting and putting on equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, located around the shoulders and on the back, guarantees increased flexibility for arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure, which offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) sealing on the face at the hood increases comfort, sealing, and durability (separate head hood).
A soft zone located in the collar improves the seal with a finely adjustable width adjustment through a flexible, gentle Velcro fastener, which does not stick to the lining or the seams.
Double cuffs with zippers on the wrists and ankles combine a foldable inner cuff with a soft, laminated neoprene outer cuff.
45° notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and resilience when putting on.
Long zipper at the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without a hood.
Long G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent).
Zippers on arms and legs.
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent tearing, in case excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels flush bonded with outer and inner overlap.
Edges of the outer cuffs lined for greater durability.
Edges of the inner cuffs are notched for increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat system was designed to secure the computer in its place, especially during deep dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist computers).
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro-pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are primarily used as load carriers in the European region.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from Statistik Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million Euros.
The number of pallets imported to Austria annually is not recorded.
Was taken by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
Can I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived at my place in three separate packages.
At least 100 dead due to tornadoes in Kentucky.
Numerous tornadoes have swept across the USA due to a devastating storm system.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths to mourn.
The images from there resemble a war zone.
On the night of Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the USA, possibly claiming up to a hundred lives.
The storms leave behind a swath of destruction about 320 kilometers long, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, everywhere the tornado had swept through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates that in the state of Kentucky alone, there could be up to a hundred deaths, with the official numbers increasing hourly.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one from #PRS_ORG#, however, I would like to handle the return as quickly as possible.
Can it not be changed or not? I like to write in English, I understand that well too.
That's already a very long time, then I would refrain from it.
Movie search help please.
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24).
I believe it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely sure).
Since I can't describe it in more detail, there is a young woman in the real world.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, paths cross and a plot unfolds.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to live himself, I believe.
I believe the transition is also the soldier's burial site.
In the end, I believe both soldiers fight against each other.
If that means anything to you, I am grateful for any answer.
Apparently, the chair had a not apparent defect at the time of sale.
How else could such upholstery damage occur after 9 months?
Oh dear, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi available.
I need to contact my husband first.
But that could take a while.
What steps do I need to take after that?
I would like to return it and then order it again, as it is currently on sale :)
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-rich comeback against Leverkusen.
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hesse team, who had recently lost two games in a row, seemingly found themselves on the path to their next Bundesliga defeat.
However, then SGE stepped up, shooting off the frustration of a mixed season start within a good hour and won furiously with a 5:2 score. "It's madness what the boys have achieved today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN, and gave a "blanket praise to every single person who was involved."
Initially, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, who are still behind their expectations in ninth place.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen ahead with a 2:0 lead.
What happened next also impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result as well.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to be on the field for the first time since the fourth matchday after overcoming his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly strong," said the 27-year-old, looking at the result with particular joy for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but also sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that all our players are fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It's top-notch work in our medical department, but the players also live very professionally.
Now, the aim is to "proceed step by step and remain modest" and to carry out the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
Next up, as part of the English week, there is an away game against Borussia Mönchengladbach (6:30 pm, Sky) on the schedule for Wednesday.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also naturally contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly due to genuine analog circuits, because they simply achieve the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a sealed enclosure and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances simply bubble out.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Naturally, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which led to another performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response.
During a thorough analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power amplifier primarily determines the tube character of an amplifier, and based on this finding, they developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The Valve Reactor circuit, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, in each VT+ amplifier perfectly replicates the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
Problems with Fiber Optic + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I am now having trouble setting up a stable Wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which, apart from a few outages, received and transmitted 50 Mbit flawlessly.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590, and these also arrive at the DLan module that is connected to the FritzBox.
However, at the other DLan module, which emits the Wifi, the full 500 no longer arrives, but the further I move away from the module in the house, the less arrives (so I use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This results in the internet, with the new fiber optic connection, now being slower on the first floor than before (~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here as well.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed "gets lost" over the power line with fiber optics?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely laborious to install LAN cables in the house.
I am really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
Therefore, I would be even more pleased to receive a response.
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to inquire about the best price for the grey leather sofa, Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you very much.
Kind regards
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes about the waiting position... I will soon give up again, because it simply does not work here.
Hello
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however, I can't collapse it and therefore shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send it back, as it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a response.
Is the battery broken?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer being charged by my power adapter.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone would also be sufficient for operation.
No luck, the battery is dead and the laptop won't start anymore despite the power adapter being plugged in.
Following that, I removed the battery, but even then nothing happened.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop when it's plugged in?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
Yes, we both have redone it and are using version 4.5...
It could be that they have heard about problems quite often.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing.
The new Federal Minister of Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as has been demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to provide tenants with the assurance that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A diverse mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives, or housing associations, by the way, is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, Greens, and Left Party wants to establish an expert commission to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out discussions with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent cap until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tense housing markets, and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Justice Minister to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, "we will discuss further steps with the coalition partners," emphasized the SPD politician.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not originally €1699?
Advice and ideas for further professional life.
First of all, Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately only moderately good, because my dear head is overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I go into detail here... in short: I need advice, preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the refresher course as a career changer.
Originally, I studied something different and worked in that field (to remain at least a little anonymous, I won't mention anything more specific here).
But the whole thing became too boring for me and I started looking for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point, I ended up in teaching and was sure that this was it - even though the conditions are significantly less flexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I have now reached the third "I am googling other job postings."
And only half a year has passed.
On the previous occasions, I always decided to continue and at least finish the reference, after which I can still switch.
But right now, I am absolutely exhausted.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely drained.
Now it may be vacation, but there is still a pile of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but back then my weekend was my weekend and my downtime was my downtime.
That day I had off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally annoy me.
Fundamentally, it's fun and from an outside perspective, the ref also runs well, as far as feedback and such is concerned.
But I am completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it completely shuts down - if it isn't doing that already.
I wonder if I want things to be like this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts - or if I should go back to my old field, where I was valued, could take time off when I needed it, and although I found the work somewhat boring, I was paid appropriately and worked as part of a team rather than as a lone fighter, which is now the case most of the time.
But then I wonder if I will end up in the same place as I am now in a year and be dissatisfied.
You'll notice, everything is somehow confusing, but perhaps as outsiders, you have advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, where I'm completely exhausted and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I will not make decisions based on emotions right now, as it probably won't lead to anything good.
But perhaps your views will help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and excuse my whiny undertone.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Theatre historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97.
He has distinguished himself as a theater critic and as a director.
Later, he wrote a monumental history of theater.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
The new book is still lying on the table, fresh from the press: "An Old Man Gets Older."
The harrowing diary of a slow farewell to the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the midst of reading, comes the news that the author has passed away.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby express my gratitude for life."
Yes, but it was called before.
They cannot deliver from England due to #PRS_ORG#.
He switched to a company that he used to criticize.
That does not make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and see.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't sew himself to his old position and looked for something else.
You are allowed to do that too.
And the fact that he didn't like you back then: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't really like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Assistance with first own campaign
Greetings from Boron!
I am currently leading an adventure called "Over the Griffin Pass" for a group of four friends and I want to seamlessly transition my heroes into a campaign specifically written for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are thought out and now I am in the process of writing the introductory adventure and I'm already tripping over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There, the further action is supposed to develop.
A few miles away from the village, a group of goblins is supposed to ambush the heroes and lure them into a trap.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: persuading, trading, threatening, recognizing the danger early on, whatever the players come up with.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers.
If unnoticed, the goblins ambush the heroes in a hollow way and flank the wagon with three on each side armed with bows, while two with spears stop the wagon.
Should a fight occur and the heroes are defeated, I have two possible solutions.
The heroes all fall unconscious and are subsequently found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
Of course, the cart is gone.
Should defeat be inevitable, this half-elf, along with two of his servants, intervenes and comes to aid the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think the Deus ex Machina is for Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group of Goblins will play a crucial role later on, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now also have more confidence in my narrative.
You can forget that, I've already explained it several times yesterday!!

Friedrich secures 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The record of 94 victories by Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen is the target of the bobsleigh pilot.
"I've done the math, I would need to secure nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, on Saturday, he fended off the attack from Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he moved from third to first place.
Then he made some changes to the material settings and on Sunday, he achieved a larger lead of 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he prevailed over the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier came in third.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also secured his 22nd consecutive victory.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who races for Stuttgart, came in fifth place this time after previously coming in second.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after ranking fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, then I would do it the same way," Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
Among the women, Laura Nolte secured her third seasonal victory in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After only managing fourth place in the monobob the previous day, she raced to a World Cup victory on Sunday with pusher Deborah Levi during the German triple success.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia, along with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen, came in second place.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she achieved her first podium finish this winter.
The Wiesbaden native Kim Kalicki, along with Leonie Fiebig, landed in third place.
For me, it was super cool, first podium place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama is taking me along.
I am super happy with the development.
"There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt, emphasizing, "It's not just about pushing off, there's also a tremendous amount to do around it."
Jamanka was a bit annoyed about the not entirely flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
When it's time to switch the current account
Anyone who thought there would be a break with the current accounts now, is mistaken.
While many banks have used the fall to confirm past fee increases from their customers using all sorts of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates continue to decrease.
For example, Deutsche Bank, with a limit of 100,000 Euros, was long considered relatively generous.
Now she has just halved the tax-free allowance and even quartered it for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank division of the corporation - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts, and to 25,000 euros for daily money accounts.
Meanwhile, these lower allowances now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
And this applies not only to new contracts, but also to "newly made individual agreements with existing customers."
The Commerzbank had already previously lowered the limit to 50,000 Euros, which still applies, as it does at ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, popular among cost-conscious customers, has lowered the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least: According to figures from the internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have an exemption limit of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which have even won their case against this regulation in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court.
Now, banks are already discussing whether they should possibly make provisions - in case the higher authorities also declare negative interest rates fundamentally inadmissible and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.

Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale.
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is believed to have committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is supposed to have overtaken illegally.
A second objection was raised against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
On the final lap, Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver occurred shortly after the end of a safety car phase, during which the Dutchman had overtaken the car in front of him.

Setback for handball women before quarterfinals against Spain.
Germany's handball women slinked off the court with their heads down and empty looks after the humiliation against Denmark.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB team suffered a severe defeat with a score of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were far too fearful and had too much respect for the opponent," judged national coach Henk Groener.
We must approach Spain differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danish team (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't maintain the flow.
"That was a bad game from all of us, we need to erase it," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the battle to reach the semi-finals, a significant improvement is needed against the 2019 World Cup runner-up next Tuesday, in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We simply weren't there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits, and demanded: "We now need to quickly look forward."
Not up to par from start to finish.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par from the kickoff.
Missed shots and technical errors in the attack, as well as gaps in the defense, were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
However, this was not the hoped-for initial spark.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make a scene - and when they did, they mostly failed due to the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game was essentially over at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke was later shown a red card for a harsh foul on her opponent.
But she is allowed to participate again in the quarterfinals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB team get somewhat better into the game and managed to get within five goals by the break.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone just seven minutes into the 9:19 mark.
Again, the Groener proteges sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is considered a medal contender in the final round.
As a result, the German team could not muster an improvement in performance and clearly lost on the court.
